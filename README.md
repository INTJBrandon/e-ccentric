# Welcome to E-Ccentric

E-ccentric is a telsa charging simulation app that allows users to "charge" their Tesla while using the web application. There's an estimation form so users can know how much they will pay before select the service. On the start charging page users may "charge" their tesla while watching seeing how much they are being charged and how long. After it's ended they may choose to pay now or later (feature not added) and then check that transaction on the transaction page.
